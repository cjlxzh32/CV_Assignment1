Assignment 2 WBS

1. Liu Zhuming: [REPORT] Describe the procedure of disparity computing given a pair of rectified images of the same scene captured from two different viewpoints.
2. Elena: [CODE] Write a computer algorithm that computes the disparity of two images. + Apply your developed algorithm to the two provided image pairs and derive the corresponding disparity maps.
3. Sun Qingmo: [REPORT] Discuss your observation of the obtained disparity maps.
4. Leslie: [REPORT] Discuss what affects the disparity map computation, and any possible improvements of your developed algorithm
5. Twilight: [CODE+REPORT] Implement and verify the improvement ideas over the provided test images. (+ report: record and discuss improvement results)
